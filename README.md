# MDSvexRS

A faster markdown preprocessor for svelte. Compiles `.md` files into `.svelte` with non-reactive blocks wrapped in direct HTML for faster compilation and rendering.

Note that this, like the original MDSvex, trusts it's input and doesn't escape HTML or script files.

This version is not yet tested and published.
